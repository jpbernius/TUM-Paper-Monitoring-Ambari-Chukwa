\subsection{How does Ambari differentiate from Chukwa?}
\label{subsec:Differentiation}

\amb and \chuk are, while both being Monitoring Systems, engineered for different use-cases. 
As stated in \ref{subsec:ConceptMonitoring}, the concept of monitoring allows different applications in the domain of \isds. 

\amb was founded to simplify the use of Hadoop Systems. It offers management, monitoring and intervening process on Hadoop Clusters.\cite{Hortonworks2013} 

\chuk offers extensive data collection capabilities, especially optimised for storing, archiving and analysing ``a large and open-ended set of time series metrics and logs.''~\cite{Boulona}

In comprehension of both applications, Ambari approaches a wilder spectrum trough out of all Hadoop tasks, while Chukwa is specialised on storing and analysing Hadoop Data. Both differ in their core range of use for Hadoop, in connection of monitoring. Amabri is not capable of monitoring the actual data value that is stored on the clusters that are getting observed, but it can monitor the health of those.\cite{ApacheSoftwareFoundation2015} While Chukwa has the ability to interpreter and analyse data on its monitored clusters.
