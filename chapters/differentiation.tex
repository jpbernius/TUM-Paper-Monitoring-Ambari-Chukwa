\subsection{How does Ambari differentiate from Chukwa?}
\label{subsec:Differentiation}

\amb and \chuk are, while both being Monitoring Systems, engineered for different use-cases. 
As stated in \ref{subsec:ConceptMonitoring}, the concept of monitoring allows different applications in the domain of \isds. 

\amb was founded to simplify the use of Hadoop Systems. It offers managment, monitoring and intervaning process on Hadoop Clusters. [20] 

\chuk offers extensive data collection capabilities, especially optimised for storing, archiving and analysing ``a large and open-ended set of time series metrics and logs.''~\cite{Boulona}

In comprehesion of both applications, Ambari approches a wilder spectrum trouh out of all Hadoop tasks, while Chukwa is specialiesd on storiging and analysing Hadoop Data. Both differ in their core range of use for Hadoop, in connection of monitoring. Amabri is not capabel of monitoring the actuall data value that is storeged on the clusters that are getting observed, but it can monitor the health of those. While Chukwa has the abilitiy to iterpreate and analyse data on its monitored clusters.
