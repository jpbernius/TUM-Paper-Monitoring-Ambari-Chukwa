%TODO: Abstract

The main topic of this paper is the concept of monitoring in distributed systems presented in \ambshort and \chukshort. 
The thesis is to explain the core difference between \ambshort and \chukshort, based on the monitoring process and find the most suited environment for each application. 
The emphasis is on the benefits that each application is offering to the current technology processes and systems. 
With a short introduction on the architectures of both applications, the core field of use can be explained. 
\ambshort's main function is to simplify the use of Hadoop, while \chukshort is specialised on log handling and archiving.
