\subsection{How is the concept of monitoring implemented in Ambari and Chukwa?}
Ambari is an open spurce framework that allows the User to monitore, manage and install Hadoop. 
\\
Ambari can be divided in two parts. First the Amabri Web which is the main plattform for users to log in and give up request that should be run throug Ambari. Secondly the Amabri Server, which is divided into smaller parts itself. The API or REST API is connected to different Web applications, the most important one the Ambari Web. Other interfaces like Microsoft System Center, are applications that allos the user to analyse the data forthermore the capabilietie of Hadoop. Amabri Server installs on each cluster an Ambari Agent, that gives every few seconds a heartbeat to the server; the server answers with an instruction for the Agengt or it sends a confermation about his current lifestatus.

To explain the process of monitoring by Ambari we wrote our own scenario. Steps Amabri will fullfile if one the Hadoop Clusters fails.
\\
Essencially, if one of the Clusters fail, the Agent on it would be movend into the inactiv state. This means it would not be able to send an heartbeat to the Ambari server. Amabri server would noticed this, in the worst case scenario, in two secondes, and start an repairing process. The User does not have to worry about the data that was on this broken cluster, because of the map and reduce prinzip there are two more copies of this data in our distributed system.
