abstract = {---Big data is a term for massive data sets, a large amount of data available in complex structured or no structure form. These vast amounts of data are generated by social media and networks, scientific instruments, mobile devices, sensor technology and networks. The process of research into massive amounts of data to reveal hidden patterns and secret correlations named as big data analytics. These useful information for companies or organizations with the help of gaining richer and deeper decision in the favor of companies betterments and getting advantage over the competition. Ability to manage, analyze, summarize, visualize, and discover knowledge from the collected unstructured data in a timely manner and in a scalable fashion is very difficult task using traditional data mining tools. To analyze the data Apache introduce a new technology called hadoop. Hadoop is open source implementation of MapReduce framework, which processes the vast amount of data in parallel on large clusters. Hadoop is combination of MapReduce and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). In this paper we are going to see an overview of big data, significance of big data, how hadoop works and different flavors of hadoop.},

Just upgrading one Hadoop component on a 2000-node cluster can take a lot of time and expertise, and there have been few tools specialized for Hadoop cluster administrators. AMBARI is an Apache incubator project to deliver Monitoring and Management functionality for Hadoop clusters. This paper presents the AMBARI tools for cluster management, specifically: Cluster pre-configuration and validation; Hadoop software deployment, installation, and smoketest; Hadoop configuration and re-config; and a basic set of management ops including start/stop service, add/remove node, etc. In providing these capabilities, AMBARI seeks to integrate with (rather than replace) existing open-source packaging and deployment technology available in most data centers, such as Puppet and Chef, Yum, Apt, and Zypper.},

@article{Ford1990,
abstract = {An examination is made of symbolic monitoring systems in which monitor correlates the activity of source code objects with lower level observable sequences of target execution events. The monitor must detect and respond to such target system states in a timely fashion in order to provide real-time monitoring response; it is consideration of this real-time monitoring constraint that sets the present work apart from other work related to distributed system monitoring or debugging. The author is interested in the costs and performance limits inherent in real-time monitoring of distributed systems in the sense that the inherent limits constrain feasible approaches to monitoring. A distributed predicate mapping system that supports a general form of distributed embedded system monitoring is described. The major results reported include a practical characterization of real-time monitoring response, an algorithm for dynamic predicate mapping, and an analysis of the computational requirements of predicate mapping that reveals the costs and resource management policies that are pertinent to guaranteeing real-time response},

@article{Jammes2012,
abstract = {In a SOA-based system the applications are organized in a manner such that interoperable services can be used from different domains. In a process industry context, different domains can refer to, for example, process instrumentation and monitoring, execution of process control, data acquisition, etc. Large process industry systems are a complex and potentially very large sets of multi-disciplinary, heterogeneous, networked distributed systems. Current industrial process control systems are typically vendor specific; in addition the different domains are associated with different layers, different standards and different technologies. In the paper the authors report about the investigations and assessments performed to find answers for four major critical questions that arise as key when technologies have to be selected and used in a true Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based distributed large scale Process Monitoring and Control system: (1) Real-time SOA (what are the limits of bringing SOA into high performance control loops?); (2) Management of large scale industrial distributed control systems (is it feasible to manage up to tens of thousands of service-oriented devices?); (3) Distributed event-based systems are asynchronous (what are the limits compared to traditional periodic scanning systems?) and (4) Service specification (which semantics are the most suitable for specifying process control and monitoring services?).},

@inproceedings{Kutare2010,
abstract = {To effectively manage large-scale data centers and utility clouds, operators must understand current system and application behaviors. This requires continuous monitoring along with online analysis of the data captured by the monitoring system. As a result, there is a need to move to systems in which both tasks can be performed in an integrated fashion, thereby better able to drive online system management. Coining the term 'monalytics' to refer to the combined monitoring and analysis systems used for managing large-scale data center systems, this paper articulates principles for monalytics systems, describes software approaches for implementing them, and provides experimental evaluations justifying principles and implementation approach. Specific technical contributions include consideration of scalability across both 'space' and 'time', the ability to dynamically deploy and adjust monalytics functionality at multiple levels of abstraction in target systems, and the capability to operate across the range of application to hypervisor layers present in large-scale data center or cloud computing systems. Our monalytics implementation targets virtualized systems and cloud infrastructures, via the integration of its functionality into the Xen hypervisor.},

abstract = {Large Internet services companies like Google, Yahoo, and Facebook use the MapReduce programming model to process log data. MapReduce is designed to work on data stored in a distributed filesystem like Hadoop’s HDFS. As a result, a number of companies have devel- oped log collection systems that write to HDFS. These systems have a number of common weaknesses, induced by the semantics of the filesystem. They impose a de- lay, often several minutes, before data is available for processing. They are difficult to integrate with exist- ing applications. They cannot reliably handle concur- rent failures. We present a system, called Chukwa, that adds the needed semantics for log collection and anal- ysis. Chukwa uses an end-to-end delivery model that leverages local on-disk log files when possible, easing integration with legacy systems. Chukwa offers a choice of delivery models, making subsets of the collected data available promptly for clients that require it, while reli- ably storing a copy in HDFS. We demonstrate that our system works correctly on a 200-node testbed and can collect in excess of 200 MB/sec of log data. We supple- ment these measurements with a set of case studies.},

abstract = {Deploying, configuring, and managing large Apache Hadoop and HBase clusters can be quite complex. Once you have your clusters, keeping them up and running and making sure that the SLAs are met presents even more challenges and headaches to Hadoop operators. To make matters worse, managing upgrades can be a nightmare. Hadoop users are presented with their own fair share of difficulties such as slow running jobs and not knowing why they are slow. For third-party software vendors interested in incorporating Hadoop management and monitoring capabilities, there does not seem to be an obvious, easy solution. Apache Ambari is aimed at making lives of Hadoop operators, users, and integrators simpler by providing a management interface to do all of that and more. This session presents usages of Ambari`s Web UI for Hadoop operators (deploying, managing, and monitoring) as well as Hadoop users (job analytics). The talk will also touch upon Ambari`s REST API and how it is used in the real world. The session concludes by revealing the future roadmap of Ambari including queue management, upgrade, disaster recovery, high availability, and more.},
